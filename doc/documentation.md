# CasinoPlugin

A Minecraft plugin which adds elements of a real casino

## Features

## Elements

This plugin needs Vault and an Economy plugin to work correctly. You can download Vault or an Economy plugin - I prefer GMoney when you don't have them on your server.

use /help casino to get detailed information about every command and click on it to invoke them
